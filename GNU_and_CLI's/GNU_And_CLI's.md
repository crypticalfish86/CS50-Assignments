A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a place like VsCode where people store programs/source code for when a program excutes

A CLI (Command Line Interface) is a place like the terminal where commands are directly inputted and executed in the terminal,
the terminal communicates directly with the operating system (either linux, windows or macOS)

Programs may be written in a GUI but must be executed via the GUI sending commands to the CLI 
or directly by the CLI
