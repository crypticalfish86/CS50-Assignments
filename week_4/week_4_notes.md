Remember that each pixel on your computer screen is
represented using RGB memory, where there is a byte
associated with the variation each of the colour red, green and blue. This memory for every pixel
is stored somewhere and has an addressin the RAM.

ever see those colour codes associated with certain
colours in CSS e.g. #E201FF

this is a hexidecimal representation, of RGB,

the first 2 digits are red, the second 2 are green
and the last 2 represent how much blue is in the 
pixel

HEXIDECIMAL

Hexidecimal is a way or writing numbers in base 16
which compresses numbers into a smaller amount of
digits however is still relatively readable to a
computer scientist.

hexidecimal digits are like this

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

so 15 in hexidecimal is F, 10 would be A and 16 
would be 10

FF would be 256 (including 0 as 1 because computer
1 is 0) coincidentally this is how many bits are in
a byte and why hexidecimal was chosen. because
its easy to represent binary in less digits
11111111 becomes FF.

F would be represented in binary with 4 bits (1111)
